## üìÑ Description - Exercise Statement

### Exercise 1
Create a Java class that manages a collection of books in a library. The class must allow adding books, retrieving the list of books, getting a specific book by its position, adding a book at a specific position, and removing a book by title.
Implement the following functionalities:
The class must allow adding books to the collection.
The complete list of books must be retrievable.
The title of a book must be obtainable given a position.
A book must be able to be added at a specific position.
A book must be able to be removed by title.
Verify its correct functionality with JUnit:
Verify that the list of books is not null after creating a new object.
Confirm that the list has an expected size after inserting several books.
Ensure that the list contains a specific book at its correct position.
Verify that there are no duplicate book titles in the list.
Check that the title of a book can be retrieved given a specific position.
Ensure that adding a book correctly modifies the list.
Confirm that removing a book decreases the size of the list.
Verify that the list remains alphabetically sorted after adding or removing a book.

### Exercise 2
Create a class called `CalculoDni` that calculates the DNI letter when receiving the number as a parameter.
Create a JUnit class that verifies its correct functionality, parameterizing it so that the test receives a wide range of data and validates whether the calculation is correct for 10 predefined DNI numbers.

### Exercise 3
Create a class with a method that throws an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`.
Verify its correct functionality with a JUnit test.
